A timer starts in the beginning of the game. The timer value can be changed as it is a public variable.
There is a cube which increases in size as time passes. We can press "Spacebar" to reduce the size of cube. Minimum size can be 1 unit.
The cube can be rotated in all directions using the "WSAD" or the arrow keys.
Press "P" to pause the game. When paused, the timer stops and the input keys are disabled.
The game ends when the timer reaches zero.
